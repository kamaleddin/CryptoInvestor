## 📊 Key Improvements

### Statistical Rigor

**Added**:
- ✅ Risk-adjusted metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar)
- ✅ Statistical significance testing (t-tests, p-values, effect sizes)
- ✅ Bootstrap confidence intervals
- ✅ Distribution analysis (skewness, kurtosis)
- ✅ Tail risk analysis (VaR, CVaR, max drawdown)
- ✅ Proper independence handling (non-overlapping periods)

**Fixed**:
- ❌ Autocorrelation issues in weekly rolling
- ❌ Missing risk adjustment in original analysis
- ❌ No statistical testing in original
- ❌ No confidence intervals

### Project Organization

**Improvements**:
- ✅ Separated code, reports, and documentation
- ✅ Clear directory structure
- ✅ Organized outputs by type
- ✅ Professional naming conventions
- ✅ Complete documentation index

---

## 🔬 Statistical Findings

### Key Discovery: **Methodology Matters!**

Different analysis methods give different conclusions:

| Method | 1-Year Optimum Avg | Conclusion |
|--------|-------------------|------------|
| Weekly Rolling | 168.68% | "Optimum beats Simple" |
| Quarterly Rolling | 272.34% | "No significant difference" (p=0.38) |
| Non-Overlapping | 114.84% | "No significant difference" (p=0.83) |

**Truth**: No statistically significant difference when using proper methods.

### Risk-Adjusted Reality

**Simple DCA wins on Sharpe ratio** (risk-adjusted returns):
- 1-Year: Simple 0.495 vs Optimum 0.488
- 2-Year: Optimum 0.397 vs Simple 0.359
- 3-Year: Simple 0.568 vs Optimum 0.350
- 4-Year: Simple 0.610 vs Optimum 0.097

**Optimum DCA wins on Sortino ratio** (downside risk):
- Better tail protection (lower VaR, CVaR)
- Higher upside potential
- More volatile but asymmetric (good volatility is upside)

## 🎯 What to Report

### ❌ Don't Say (Misleading)
"Optimum DCA significantly outperforms Simple DCA with 72.4% win rate"
- Based on overlapping data
- No statistical testing
- Invalid inference

### ✅ Do Say (Accurate)
"Using quarterly rolling windows (n=36 periods), Optimum DCA showed higher average returns but greater volatility. The difference was not statistically significant (p=0.38). However, Optimum demonstrated superior downside protection (Sortino: 29.6 vs 3.8) and better tail risk metrics (VaR: -33% vs -42%)."
