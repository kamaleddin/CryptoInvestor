EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
====================================================================================================

Three different methodologies were used to analyze DCA strategy performance:

1. DURATION SIMULATOR (Weekly Rolling)
   - Maximum data utilization: 1,512 simulations
   - High autocorrelation: ~98% overlap
   - Best for: Pattern exploration, not statistical inference

2. BALANCED ROLLING (Monthly Steps - v2.1 OPTIMIZED)
   - Large data: 378 simulations (~30 effective)
   - Manageable autocorrelation: ~92% overlap
   - Best for: Standard analysis with risk metrics ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

3. NON-OVERLAPPING (Perfect Independence)
   - Minimal data: 18 simulations
   - Zero autocorrelation: 0% overlap
   - Best for: Academic rigor, conservative estimates

KEY FINDINGS & RECOMMENDATIONS
====================================================================================================

1. STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
   ‚ùå NO statistically significant difference between Optimum and Simple DCA
      in any duration when using proper non-overlapping analysis
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Weekly rolling results are misleading due to high autocorrelation

2. RISK-ADJUSTED PERFORMANCE:
   ‚Ä¢ Simple DCA generally has better Sharpe ratios (better risk-adjusted returns)
   ‚Ä¢ Optimum DCA has better Sortino ratios (better downside-risk-adjusted returns)
   ‚Ä¢ Optimum DCA has better tail risk protection (lower VaR in most cases)

3. METHODOLOGY MATTERS:
   ‚Ä¢ Choice of methodology dramatically affects conclusions
   ‚Ä¢ Weekly rolling overstates Optimum's advantage
   ‚Ä¢ Non-overlapping provides most conservative estimates
   ‚Ä¢ Quarterly rolling provides best balance ‚≠ê

4. PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
   For 1-2 Year Horizons:
      ‚Ä¢ Use Optimum DCA if you can tolerate volatility for upside potential
      ‚Ä¢ Better downside protection than Simple DCA
      ‚Ä¢ But no guarantee of outperformance

   For 3-4 Year Horizons:
      ‚Ä¢ Simple DCA more reliable and consistent
      ‚Ä¢ Better risk-adjusted returns
      ‚Ä¢ 100% win rate in non-overlapping periods

   For Risk-Averse Investors:
      ‚Ä¢ Simple DCA: Lower volatility, more predictable

   For Risk-Tolerant Investors:
      ‚Ä¢ Optimum DCA: Higher upside potential, better tail protection

5. WHICH ANALYSIS TO USE:
   üìä Duration Simulator: Exploration, pattern finding, NOT statistical inference
   ‚≠ê Balanced Rolling: Standard analysis, most practical (RECOMMENDED)
   üéì Non-Overlapping: Academic papers, regulatory filings, maximum rigor
