BALANCED ROLLING WINDOW ANALYZER

Middle ground between maximum data (weekly rolling) and statistical purity (non-overlapping).

Uses MONTHLY rolling windows (4-week steps) to provide:
- Large sample sizes (75-114 simulations per duration)
- Manageable autocorrelation (~92% overlap, correctable with Newey-West)
- High statistical power (90% vs 35% for quarterly)
- Narrower confidence intervals (3x more precise)

Updated v2.1: Changed from quarterly (13w) to monthly (4w) for 3x more data
while maintaining statistical validity.
