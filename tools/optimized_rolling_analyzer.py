OPTIMIZED ROLLING WINDOW ANALYZER

Maximizes useful simulations while maintaining statistical validity.

Key Improvement: Uses MONTHLY (4-week) steps instead of quarterly
- 3x more simulations (75-114 vs 24-36)
- Still manageable autocorrelation (~92% vs ~75%)
- Better statistical power

Comparison:
- Monthly (4w):     75-114 sims, 92-98% overlap, effective N ≈ 2-9
- Quarterly (13w):  24-36 sims,  75-94% overlap, effective N ≈ 1.5-9 (old)
- Semi-annual (26w): 12-18 sims, 50-87% overlap, effective N ≈ 1.5-9
