## 📊 Three Analysis Methods

| Tool | When to Use | Simulations | Independence |
|------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| `duration_simulator.py` | Explore patterns | 1,512 | ❌ Low (~2%) |
| `balanced_rolling_analyzer.py` ⭐ | Standard analysis | **378** (monthly) | ⚠️ Good (~8%) |
| `advanced_duration_analyzer.py` | Academic/regulatory | 18 | ✅ Perfect (100%) |

**v2.1 Update**: balanced_rolling_analyzer now uses monthly (4-week) steps instead of quarterly (13-week)  
**Result**: 3x more simulations (378 vs 120) with similar statistical validity!

## 🔬 Key Metrics Explained

| Metric | What It Measures | Higher = Better? |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| **Sharpe Ratio** | Return per unit of total risk | ✅ Yes |
| **Sortino Ratio** | Return per unit of downside risk | ✅ Yes |
| **Max Drawdown** | Worst peak-to-trough decline | ❌ No (lower better) |
| **VaR (95%)** | Max loss at 95% confidence | ❌ No (higher better, less negative) |
| **CVaR (95%)** | Average loss in worst 5% | ❌ No (higher better, less negative) |
| **P-value** | Statistical significance | < 0.05 = significant |

## 🎯 Main Finding

**No statistically significant difference** between Optimum and Simple DCA when using proper methods!

- Weekly rolling (misleading): "Optimum wins" ❌
- Quarterly rolling (valid): "No difference" (p=0.38) ✅
- Non-overlapping (rigorous): "No difference" (p=0.83) ✅

**Choice depends on**: Risk tolerance + Investment horizon
