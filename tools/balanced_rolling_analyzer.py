BALANCED ROLLING WINDOW ANALYZER

Middle ground between maximum data (weekly rolling) and statistical purity (non-overlapping).

Uses QUARTERLY rolling windows (13-week steps) to provide:
- Larger sample sizes than non-overlapping
- Reduced autocorrelation vs weekly rolling
- Practical balance for analysis

Based on research: Quarterly rebalancing common in portfolio management,
and 13-week correlation significantly lower than 1-week.
