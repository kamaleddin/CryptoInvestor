OVERALL CONCLUSION:
  ✗ FAILURE: The Python implementation has significant discrepancies
    from the Excel calculations that require investigation.
    - Weekly table calculations need attention
    - WDCA schedule calculations need attention

RECOMMENDATIONS:
  • Investigate discrepancies in failing test cases
  • Review calculation formulas against Excel implementation
  • Consider improving data preprocessing steps
  • Re-test after fixing identified issues
